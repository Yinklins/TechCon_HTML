        <h3>History</h3>
        <article>
            <p>TechCon, as a concept, represents the long-standing human tradition of gathering to exchange knowledge and showcase technological advancements. While the modern term may refer to a specific conference or brand, its essence dates back to ancient times. From early civilizations where artisans and engineers collaborated on monumental projects like the pyramids, to medieval guilds that fostered craftsmanship and knowledge-sharing, these gatherings have always been central to innovation. The Renaissance and Scientific Revolution further formalized this through the formation of academies and scientific societies, while the invention of the printing press revolutionized the spread of information.</p>
            <p>During the Industrial Revolution, large-scale exhibitions like the Great Exhibition of 1851 demonstrated how societies began organizing events specifically to highlight new inventions and industrial achievements. The 20th century ushered in a new era of specialized conferences tied to rapid advances in computing and telecommunications. Organizations such as the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and events like the National Computer Conference (NCC) became platforms for sharing breakthroughs. As digital technologies expanded, so did the variety of tech conferences, covering topics like software development, hardware, artificial intelligence, and blockchain.</p>
            <p>Throughout history, key innovations—such as stone tools, agriculture, metallurgy, the printing press, electricity, and the steam engine—have continually reshaped societies. The invention of the computer and the rise of the internet brought about a new digital age, connecting people globally and transforming communication. Mobile devices and artificial intelligence now dominate the current landscape, shaping the future of healthcare, transportation, education, and more. TechCon, in its current form, continues this legacy by bringing innovators together to discuss, learn, and lead in the age of rapid technological advancement.</p>
